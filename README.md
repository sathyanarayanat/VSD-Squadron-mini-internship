#IOT HOME AUTOMATION USING BLYNK APP 

#**PROJECT OVERVIEW**
In this project, We build a system that utilises CH32V003 RISC-V processor and the Blynk app to convert traditional home appliances into IoT-enabled devices. The system incorporates the ESP32 for its built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities. When the user sends an ON/OFF command through the Blynk app, it's transmitted to the ESP32 via Wi-Fi, which then activates a GPIO port in the VSDsquardron mini. This signal controls a servo motor connected to the VSDsquadron mini, allowing for remote operation of the home appliances.By integrating the Blynk app with the CH32V003 RISC-V processor and ESP32, users can conveniently manage their appliances from anywhere using a smartphone or tablet. This enhances user convenience, improves energy efficiency by enabling remote power management, and adds a layer of automation to household tasks. Additionally, the use of IoT technology increases the versatility and functionality of conventional home appliances, aligning them with modern smart home standards.
